## Bad Choices: How algorithms can help you think smarter and live happier
Ali Almossawi (2017)

TLDR; Book about algorithms being applied in mundane tasks. Ideal read for people who are beginning their study in Data Structures but also a good read for anyone in the Computer Science field to understand more day-to-day applications.

### Key Points
* "Recognizing good and bad .. task"
* "Algorithm can be used as a tool for smarter thinking."

* Fundamentals: Stacks, Arrays, Asymptotic Notation, Wosrt and average cases, linked lists
* Searching: binary, linear, hash tables
* Sorting: library, insertion, quick, merge, priority queues
* Graphs: maze-solving, link analysis
* Strings: Huffman coding

| 1. Match those socks | <ul><li>AlphaGo: ammasses a greater memory from which to work</li><li>"Many of the faster ways of solving problems in this book, are fast because of their ability to avoid doing the same action on the same thing multiple times."</li><li>ritish TV show Countdown: contestants have 30 seconds to come up with the longest word they can make from the nice letters in front of them</li><li>"Trie": tree-based structure that exploits the fact that words or numbers share prefixes and uses that knowledge to make things like spell-checking and auto-completing words that you might enter into a search box much faster</li></ul> |
| 2. Find your size | <ul><li>Binary vs Linear search</li><li>Binary: method of logarithmically searching for something in a sorted collection</li></ul> |
| 3. Pop to the shops | <ul><li>Stack: we care a lot about peeking at the top item</li><li>The Flynn effect: "humanity has been getting smarter in part because our intuitions continue to mature and become more sophisticated"</li></ul> |
| 4. Bring him home | <ul><li>Maze solving</li></ul> |
| 5. Sort that post | <ul><li>Insertion, selection, bubble sort</li><li>Dividing and conquering</li><li>Page 47: linearithmic *O(n log n)* (mergesort by John von Neumann and quicksort by Tony Hoare)</li></ul> |
| 6. Be more hip | <ul><li>Matrix multiplication</li><li>Jaccard index</li><li>Link analysis</li></ul> |
| 7. Update that status | <ul><li>The brain has the ability to detect salience. Information that occurs more often is considered less meaningful</li><li>Run-time and space complexity</li><li>David A. Huffman: variable-length binary code. He exploited the fact that some characters in a sentence appear more often than other ones.</li><li>Data compression: Huffman coding</li></ul> |
| 8. Get the jobs done | <ul><li>Context switching</li><li>Pipelining</li><li>Dijkstra's algorithm, graph-search algorithm</li><li>Priority queue</li></ul> |
| 9. Fix the necklace | <ul><li>Linked list: adds and removes items at a constant time</li></ul> |
| 10. Locate that box  | <ul><li>Big-theta and big-omega notations: upper and lowers bounds</li></ul> |
| 11. Fill those shelves | <ul><li>Library sort or gapped-insertion sort</li></ul> |
| 12. Navigate those aisles | <ul><li>Matrix: array of array (2D array), multi-dimensional array</li><li>"I put an array in your array so you won't got astray"</li><li>Hash table<ul><li>Collisions. Solution: chaining (collection of collections hash table)</li><li>Load factor: 0 (empty) - 1 (full)</li></ul></li><li>Priority queue<ul><li>Heap: tree of nodes, balancing tree.</li><li>Properties: every node has lower priority than its parent and each node has 2 child nodes to ensure $height \leq log(n)$, where n is the number of items in the heap.</li></ul></li><li>Binary search tree</li><li>FIFO queue</li></ul> |
