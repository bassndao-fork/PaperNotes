## Bad Choices: How algorithms can help you think smarter and live happier
Ali Almossawi (2017)

TLDR; Book about algorithms being applied in mundane tasks.

### Key Points
0. Introduction
* Heaviside: "Shall I refuse my dinner because I do not understand digestion?"
* Memento: book or movie?
1. Match those socks
  * AlphaGo: ammasses a greater memory from which to work
  * "Many of the faster ways of solving problems in this book, are fast because of their ability to avoid doing the same action on the same thing multiple times."
  * British TV show countdown: contestants have 30 seconds to come up with the longest word they can make from the nice letters in front of them
  * "Trie": tree-based structure that exploits the fact that words or numbers share prefixes and uses that knowledge to make things like spell-checking and auto-completing words that you might enter into a search box much faster
2. Find your size
  * Binary vs Linear search
  * Binary: method of logarithmically searching for something in a sorted collection
3. Pop to the shops
  * Stack: we care a lot about peeking at the top item
  * The Flynn effect: "humanity has been getting smarter in part because our intuitions continue to mature and become more sophisticated"
5. Sort that post
  * Insertion, selection, bubble sort
  * Dividing and conquering
  * Page 47: linearithmic (mergesort by John von Neumann and quicksort by Tony Hoare)
6. Be more hip
  * Matrix multiplication
  * Jaccard index
  * Link analysis
7. Update that status  
  
  
### Notes / Questions
* Ideal read for people who are beginning their study in Data Structures but also a good read for anyone in the Computer Science field to understand more day-to-day applications.
