TLDR; Deep image reconstruction model used to reconstruct perceptual and mental content from human brain activity combining visual features from the multiple layers of a DNN.

### Key Points
* Model visualizes perceptual content from human brain activity.
* Recent work showed that visual cortical activity can be decoded (translated) into hierarchical features of a deep neural network (DNN) for the same input image, providing a way to make use of the information from hierarchical visual features (Horikawa & Kamitani, 2017). Here, we present a novel image reconstruction method, in which the pixel values of an image are optimized to make its DNN features similar to those decoded from human brain activity at multiple layers
* Although sophisticated decoding and encoding models have been developed to render human brain activity into images or movies, the methods were essentially limited to the image reconstruction with low-level image bases (Miyawaki et al., 2008; Wen et al., 2016) or to the matching to exemplar images or movies (Naselaris et al., 2009; Nishimoto et al., 2011), failing to combine visual features of multiple hierarchical levels.
