TLDR; Deep image reconstruction model used to reconstruct perceptual and mental content from human brain activity combining visual features from the multiple layers of a DNN.

### Key Points
* Model visualizes perceptual content from human brain activity.
* Reconstruction of visual images from human brain activity measured by fMRI. To reconstruct visual images, we first decoded (translated) measured brain activity patterns into deep neural network (DNN) features, then fed those decoded features to a reconstruction algorithm. Our reconstruction algorithm starts from a given initial image and iteratively optimizes the pixel values so that the DNN features of the current image become similar to those decoded from brain activity. The movies can be seen from our [repository](https://www.youtube.com/user/ATRDNI)
* Recent work showed that visual cortical activity can be decoded (translated) into hierarchical features of a deep neural network (DNN) for the same input image, providing a way to make use of the information from hierarchical visual features (Horikawa & Kamitani, 2017). Here, we present a novel image reconstruction method, in which the pixel values of an image are optimized to make its DNN features similar to those decoded from human brain activity at multiple layers
* Although sophisticated decoding and encoding models have been developed to render human brain activity into images or movies, the methods were essentially limited to the image reconstruction with low-level image bases (Miyawaki et al., 2008; Wen et al., 2016) or to the matching to exemplar images or movies (Naselaris et al., 2009; Nishimoto et al., 2011), failing to combine visual features of multiple hierarchical levels.
