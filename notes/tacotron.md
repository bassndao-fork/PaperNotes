## [Tacotron: Towards End-to-End Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10135)
Yuxuan Wang et al., Submitted on 29 Mar 2017

TLDR; Tacotron is an end-to-end generative text-to-speech (TTS) model that synthesizes speech directly from characters. Tacotron achieves a 3.82/5 mean opinion score (MOS) on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. In addition, since Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, it's substantially faster than sample-level autoregressive methods.

### Key Points
* Given <text, audio> pairs, the model can be trained completely from scratch with random initialization.
