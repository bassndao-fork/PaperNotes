TLDR; The authors present a literary-adpated NMT system applied to novels (literary text) in the English-Catalan language domain.

### Key Points
* Literary text: considered to be the greatest challenge for Machine Translation (MT)
* Neural vs Phrase-based Statistical MT (PBSMT)
* Recent emergence of two unrelated technologies opens a window of opportunity to explore this topic:
  * E-books for building dataset
  * NMT: performance seems to be especially promising for lexically-rich texts  and there are claims that it “can, rather than do a literal translation, find the cultural equivalent in another language”.
* *Goal of paper*: assess the performance that can be offered by state- of-the-art MT for literary texts  
* *Dataset*: trained on large amounts of literary texts (over 100 million words) and evaluated on a set of 12 novels from the 1920s to the present day

### Notes / Questions
* State-of-the-Art in MT of Literary Text

### Results
* BLEU score: NMT is significantly better than PBSMT (11% improvement)
