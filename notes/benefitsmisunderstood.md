## [Don't Underestimate the Benefits of Being Misunderstood](http://web.mit.edu/futrell/www/papers/gibson2017dont.pdf)

TLDR; Premise that accent can be considered a noisy channel for language understanding and that native speakers give non-native speakers the benefit of the doubt, increasing the likelihood that they'll be understood even with heavy accent or incorrect grammar.

### Key Points
* Not a deep learning paper, subjects experiments
* Perceived noise: misspellings, added or deleted words, words swapped
* Native speakers give foreign-accented speakers the benefit of the doubt when interpreting their utterances.
* Noise manipulation: accent vs no-accent
* This paper focuses on the meaning interpretation of an utterance. However, speaking incorrectly also has the "disadvantage of being perceived as syntactically unstable [...], which in turn might give rise to the perception of reduced intelligence and credibility." 

### Notes / Questions
* Plausible x Implausible sentences:
    * Plausible: "The mother gave the daughter the candle" -> "The mother gave the candle to the daughter"
    * Implausible: "The mother gave the candle the daughter" -> "The mother gave the daughter to the candle"
* Inspiration: "recent reconceptualization of high-level language interpretation as a combination of knowledge of (a) what is likely to be communicated (priors) and (b) how messages can get corrupted by noise during com-munication (e.g., Gibson, Bergen, and Piantadosi, 2013; Levy, 2008; Levy et al., 2009)."

### Results
* Authors "observed more plausibility-based inferences (~10%) for sentences produced with an accent than for sentences produced without an accent."
* Surverys were posted on Amazon's Mechanical Turk
* yes/no questions, transcriptions
* 3 Experiments:
    1. DO-PO alternation
    2. Transitive and intransitive verbs
    3. Active and passive voice
* Materials available at the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/7c9bw)
