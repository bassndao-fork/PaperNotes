Feb 20 2015 Symposia

TLDR; Notes regarding 3 talks in the Center for Academic Research & Training in Anthropogeny (CARTA) "How Language Evolves" Symposium.

### [*What Can You Say without Syntax*](https://carta.anthropogeny.org/mediaplayer/play/152794/10364) - Ray Jackendoff
* Speaking: bottom-up; Comprehension: top-down
* Ape cognition:  "no mapping of thoughts to phonetic patterns"
* Derek Bickerton: protolanguage (subset of full language system, omitting morphology and syntax - Linear Grammar)
* Examples of language stances using linear grammar (Home Sign, Village sign languages such as ABSL, Riau Indonesian, Piraha)

### [*Specialization for Language in the Human Brain*](https://carta.anthropogeny.org/mediaplayer/play/152795/10365) - Evelina Fedorenko
* Ultimate goal: to understand the representations stored and the computations performed by the language regions
* Focus: "What is the relationship between the language system and the rest of human cognition?"
* Tom Lubbock (brain tumor patient): "My language to describe things in the world is very small, limited. My thoughts when I look at the world are vast, limitless and normal, same as they ever were. My experience of the world is not made less by lack of language but is essentially unchanged." -> **separability of thought and language**
* Language is not innate
* Language: a useful code for our thoughts

### [*How the Environment Shapes Language in the Brain*](https://carta.anthropogeny.org/mediaplayer/play/152796/10366) - Rachel Mayberry
* How does the **age** you learn your first language affect your language learning skills
* Different areas of the brain get developed
* The older the person learns a first language, the harder it is for them to learn it later in life
* Comparison studies between hearing impared and hearing abled kids, and kids learning a first language later in life versus kids learning a second language
