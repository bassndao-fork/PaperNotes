## My Notes on Solutions for Imbalanced data

TLDR; Two main techniques are used to improved accuracy classification tasks using imbalanced data: under-sampling of majority classes and over-sampling of minority classes.

### Problem
* *Description*:
    * "A dataset is called imbalanced when the number of instances belonging to the class of interest (minor class) is much lower than the ones of other classes (major classes). Association rules belonging to minor classes are rare as compared with ones that predict major classes. Consequently, this yields to a misclassification of the testing samples belonging to minor classes." [8]
    * If the ratio is more than 10:1 then the dataset is considered imbalanced [16]
    * Associated to the **Small AI** area of research ([source](https://medium.com/opla/small-data-is-big-in-ai-train-spotting-at-france-is-ai-4afb24168e4c))

* *Classical classifiers* [8]: 
    * Aim: minimize/reduce error rate and maximize accuracy
    * "assume a balanced class distribution and an equal cost of misclassification errors"
    * Result in lower accuracy when applied to imbalanced data

* *Solution*: "Alter the class distributions toward a more balanced distribution" (data level) [4] or modify the classifier itself (algorithm level)

#### Under-sampling
* Goal: "decrease the population of the majority class by ignoring a large number of its instances" [8]
* (+) Less computationally expensive 
* (-) "potentially useful information may be lost during the sampling process" [8]
* Approaches:
    * Under-sampling in sentiment analysis: remove similar, remove farthest, and remove by clustering [1]
    * Tomek Link [6]:
      * Distance between a and b: d(a,b)
      * "A(a,b) is a Tomek Link if there is not an example c such that d(a,c)<d(a,b) or d(b,c)<d(a,b). If two examples form a Tomek link, then either one of these examples is noise or both examples are border-line." [4] 
    * One-sided selection (OSS) [7]: "samples of majority class are removed that are considered either noisy or redundant"

#### Over-sampling
* Goal: "increase the population of minority class by replicating its instances" [8]
* (+) No loss of data, larger training set, more generalized classifiers
* (-) Possible overfitting and computational overhead
* Approaches:
    * VOS (2018) [11]: Variational oversampling of imbalanced data with VAE
    * [S-VAE](https://nicola-decao.github.io/s-vae) (2018) [12]: "variational auto-encoder with a hyperspherical latent space" (instead of a conventional gaussian)
    * Evolutionary-SVM Algorithm (2011) [4]: use of "mutation and crossover operators to decrease the imbalance ratio" + "clustering for both classes to delete redundant and noisy samples"
    * ADASYN [16,17] (2008): improved version of SMOTE, "After creating those sample it adds a random small values to the points thus making it more realistic", "samples are scattered, thus are not linearly correlated to the parents"
    * [SMOTE](./smote.md) [[code](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/over_sampling.html?highlight=smote)] (2002): over-sampling of minority class with sample generation in the feature space via feature vector and k-nearest neighbour manipulation [3]
    * [SMRT](https://github.com/tgsmith61591/smrt/blob/master/doc/smrt.tex) (Synthetic Minority Reconstruction Technique) [[code](https://github.com/tgsmith61591/smrt)]: younger version of SMOTE, uses variational auto-encoders to generate synthetic observations of minority class
    * Collection of GAN for image ([PyTorch](https://github.com/znxlwm/pytorch-generative-model-collections)) 
* Data augmentation in text:
    * [EDA](./eda.md) [[code](https://github.com/jasonwei20/eda_nlp)] (2019) [2]: data augmentation for text (synonym replacement, random insertion, random swap and random deletion) [2]
    * Applied to hotel reviews [[blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-augmentation-for-text-data-obtain-more-data-faster-525f7957acc9), [sklearn](https://github.com/Nandee89/data-augmentation-for-text/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb)]: manual labelling, TfidfVectorizer feature extractor
    * Resume classification [[blog](https://medium.com/bcggamma/shuffling-paragraphs-using-data-augmentation-in-nlp-to-increase-accuracy-477388746bd9)] (May 2018): shuffling of sentences and sections to create new documents
    * [nlpaug](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-augmentation-library-for-text-9661736b13ff) Python library (Apr 2019)
    * Opla.ai (2019) [[code](https://github.com/Opla/SmallData-Augmentation-MachineLearning)] [14]:
        * Word/sentence shuffling: if word order doesn't matter
        * Word replacement: words by synonym and expressions by paraphrases
        * Syntax-tree manipulation: generate syntactic paraphrases (computationally expensive)
        * Query expansion: finds "new sentences similar to a given sentence by considering this latter as query and searching for its answer"
        
### Algorithm-level approaches
* Modifies the classifier itself
* *Cost-sensitive learning*:
    * apply "a misclassification cost to the incorrectly classified instance" [8]
    * "cost of misclassifying minority samples is higher than the majority samples" [4]
    * "consists in only learning from the minor class by treating major classâ€™ instances as outliers" [8]
    * Examples:
        * RIPPER (Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction): rule induction learning algorithm
        * HIPPO
        * Class weights in loss function ([PyTorch](https://github.com/emredog/FCNN-example), 2018)
* *Example reweighting*:    
    * [*Learning to Reweight Examples for Robust Deep Learning*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09050.pdf) (ICML 2018) [[PyTorch](https://github.com/danieltan07/learning-to-reweight-examples), [Tesorflow](https://github.com/uber-research/learning-to-reweight-examples)]
    * Term weighting in text (2007) [13]
 
* *Boosting algorithm*: such as Adaboost (ensemble learning model). "In every iteration, weights are modified with the objective of correctly classifying examples in the next iteration". "[...] weighted vote to classify unlabeled examples".
    * [CUSBoost](https://github.com/farshidrayhanuiu/CUSBoost) (CSITSS 2017): "clustering-based under-sampling approach with boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm"
    * RAMOBoost (2010): ranked minority oversampling in Boosting
    * RUSBoost (2008): random under-sampling with AdaBoost
    * SMOTEBoost (2003): synthetic minority over-sampling with AdaBoost
    * Minimalist Python-based implementations of algorithms ([Tensorflow](https://github.com/dialnd/imbalanced-algorithms)): under and over-sampling and ensemble sampling (RAMOBoost, RUSBoost, SMOTEBoost)

### Evaluation metrics
* ACCURACY IS MISLEADING: an untrained classifier on a highly imbalanced dataset can give better accuracy than a trained one. The trained one will also be biased to the majority class. Thus, accuracy should not be used as a metric of good performance.
* F-score: weighted average of precision and recall, "combines Precision and Recall into a single measure that reflects the goodness of a classifier in the presence of rare classes" [9]
* Geometric mean (Gmean) [10]
  * "one of standard evaluation measures used in an imbalanced dataset classifier"
  * "product of the prediction accuracies of minor and major classes"
* Confusion matrix: "helps break down the predictive performances on different classes" [19]

* Per-class accuracy of minor class
* Bayes Imbalance Impact Index [5]
  * "Measurement about the extent of influence of class imbalance on the classification performance of imbalanced data"
  * Indicates which "data factor is actually the main barrier for classification"
  * Theoretical
  * "highly consistent with the improvement of F1 score made by the imbalance recovery methods on both synthetic and real benchmark datasets"
* ROC: Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (False Positive Rate vs True Positive Rate)
  <p align="center">
  <img src="./imgs/imblanced_roc.png" height="300" alt="Imbalanced ROC">
  </p>
  
  > [Image source](https://towardsdatascience.com/handling-imbalanced-datasets-in-machine-learning-7a0e84220f28), in the high performance model, precision doesn't need to be sacrificed to get a high recall [20]

* AUC: area under the ROC (or PR) curve (tends to 1.0 for best case and 0.5 for worst case)
* Precision-Recall (PR) curve is recommended over ROC for imbalanced data [19]

### Applications with imbalanced data
* Fraud: fraudulent telephone calls, [credit card fraud detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/home)
* Text classification (sentiment analysis, intent classification, language recognition)
* Information retrieval and filtering tasks
* Data mining for direct marketing
* Medical diagnosis: disease cases are less than healthy cases, prediction of rare adverse drug reactions, prediction gene families
* Security: network intrusion detection, counter-terrorism
* Spam detection
